			<h2>An Analysis of the Malaysia's 15th General Election</h2>
			<p>
				Malaysia's 15th General Election (GE15) was held on Nov 19, 2022. It was
				the first general election to be held after the implementation of
				UNDI18, which allows Malaysians who are 18 years old or above to vote in
				national elections. The election comes amidst a season of political
				turmoil (three prime ministers in four years), which followed the
				watershed May 2018 elections that saw the ruling coalition lose power
				for the first time since independence. The political landscape has made
				this election particularly unpredictable. The aim of my project is to
				give an overview of Malaysia’s 15th General Election. <br />

				This webpage is built using HTML, CSS and Javascript. It uses the
				<a href="https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/">vega-lite</a> Javascript API
				for constructing simple and interactive visualizations. Before building
				the front-end, the data is downloaded for preprocessing. All data is
				sourced from the
				<a href="https://dashboard.spr.gov.my/#!/home"
					>Malaysia General Election Website</a
				>.

				<br />
				<br />While the data available is relatively clean, preprocessing is
				still required before it can be utilized. Most of the challenges faced
				during this stage came from turning the data into something that can be
				used with ease. This involves removing unnecessary columns, transforming
				the data into the desired format, and translating certain data from
				Malay to English. Futhermore, some data must also be derived manually by
				performing operations on columns. Therefore, Python and its Pandas
				library are used extensively
				<a
					href="https://github.com/karmun2710/karmun2710.github.io/tree/main/python_analysis"
					>in this stage</a
				>. Complicated visualizations that plot based on geography (e.g
				chloropleth charts) are also created through Python's Matplotlib and
				GeoPandas.

				<p>
					The graphs above show the voter turnout for the 14th and 15th general
					elections in Malaysia. From the graphs, we can see that after the
					implementation of UNDI18, the number of people who voted in the 15th
					election was more than the number of people who registered to vote in
					the 14th election.

					This is a choropleth map that shows that voter turnout for each

					despite having more parliamentary seats, there are overall
					significantly higher turnouts in West Malaysia than East Malaysia. The
					data is downloaded from SPR.gov.my. Python is used to construct this

				AGE, GENDER AND ETHNICITY OF CANDIDATES RUNNING FOR MALAYSIA’S 15TH

				In this section, we break down every GE15 candidates by their age,

				website. No pre-processing is done. After uploading the data onto
				Github, the data is vizualized through Vega.js.

					It is clear to see that male candidates dominate the election
					landscape.

				<div id="ethnicityChart" class="project_img"></div>
				<p>
					Bumiputera candidates are the clear majority, followed by Chinese
					candidates, Indian candidates and others.
				</p>
				<div id="ageChart" class="project_img"></div>
				<p>
					The median age of candidates is within the 50 to 60 years old range.

				<p>
					By observation, there is no obvious trend on the age of the prime
					minister throughout the years. Nonetheless, there are clear outliers.
					For instance, from 2018 to 2020, Tun Dr Mahathir was elected a second
					time to office, becoming the oldest serving state leader at 92 years
					old. The dataset pre-processing is done through Python which can be
