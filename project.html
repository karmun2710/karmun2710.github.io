			<h2>An Analysis of the Malaysia's 15th General Election</h2>
			<h3>
				Malaysia's 15th General Election (GE15) was held on Nov 19, 2022. It was
				the first general election to be held after the implementation of
				UNDI18, which allows Malaysians who are 18 years old or above to vote in
				national elections. The election comes amidst a season of political
				turmoil (three prime ministers in four years), which followed the
				watershed May 2018 elections that saw the ruling coalition lose power
				for the first time since independence. The political landscape has made
				this election particularly unpredictable. The aim of my project is to
				give an overview of Malaysia’s 15th General Election. <br />
				<br />
				This project uses Python to clean and process the data. It then uses
				Javascript to build the charts. For more complicated visualizations,
				Python's Matplotlib library is used instead.

				<p>
					The graphs above show the voter turnout for the 14th and 15th general
					elections in Malaysia. From the graphs, we can see that after the
					implementation of UNDI18, the number of people who voted in the 15th
					election was more than the number of people who registered to vote in
					the 14th election.
