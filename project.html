			<h2>An Analysis of the Malaysia's 15th General Election</h2>
			<p>
				Malaysia's 15th General Election (GE15) was held on Nov 19, 2022. It was
				the first General Election to be held after the implementation of
				UNDI18, which allows Malaysians who are 18 years old or above to vote in
				national elections. The election comes amidst a season of political
				turmoil (three prime ministers in four years), which followed the
				watershed May 2018 elections that saw the ruling coalition lose power
				for the first time since independence. The political landscape has made
				this election particularly unpredictable. The aim of my project is to
				give an overview of Malaysia’s 15th General Election. <br />

				Age, Gender and Ethnicity of Candidates Running for Malaysia's 15th
				General Election

				In this section, we break down every GE15 candidates by their age,

				<a href="https://dashboard.spr.gov.my/#!/home"

				data is vizualized through Vega.js.

			<h2>Voter Turnout</h2>
			<p>
				These charts compares the hourly figures between GE14 and GE15. One
				thing to note here is that it is normal to observe higher number of
				votes in GE15 despite lower turnout. This is because of the introduction
				of automatic voter registration and the lowering of legal voting age to
				in GE15. Data is sourced from this

			<h2>Ethnicity and GE15 Results</h2>
			<p>
				It is important to look through the results on the peninsula to get a
				sense of how ethnicity structures Malaysian politics. I compare the vote
				share for each coalition with the bumiputera population share within
				that constituency.
				<b
					>Blue points are where the coalition in question lost; red points are
					where they won. </b
				>The deep structure of peninsular Malaysian politics jumps right out.
				There is one coalition that fares well in non-Malay majority
				constituencies. And the other two fare well in Malay-majority
				constituencies. We can see that the battleground is the mixed
				constituencies on the peninsula with 20-40% non-bumiputera populations.

					This is a choropleth map that shows the percentage of spoilt or
					rejected votes for each parliamentary seat. This chart is chosen
					because it allows for more intuitive and quicker interpretation of the
					data. We can see that rural areas, such as the north of the peninsula,
					tend to have a higher rate of rejected or spoilt votes. Data is
					downloaded from the

					Malaysia had three Prime Ministers in a short span of 4 years. By
					observation, there is no obvious trend on the age of the prime
					minister throughout the years. Nonetheless, there are clear outliers.
					For instance, from 2018 to 2020, Tun Dr Mahathir was elected a second
					time to office, becoming the oldest serving state leader at 92 years
					old. The dataset pre-processing is done through Python which can be

			<h2>Data and Challenges faced</h2>
			<p>
				This webpage is built using HTML, CSS and Javascript. It uses the
				<a href="https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/">vega-lite</a> Javascript API
				for constructing simple and interactive visualizations. Before building
				the front-end, the data is downloaded for preprocessing. All data is
				sourced from the
				<a href="https://dashboard.spr.gov.my/#!/home"
					>Malaysia General Election Website</a
				>.

				<br />
				<br />While the data available is relatively clean, preprocessing is
				still required before it can be utilized. Most of the challenges faced
				during this stage came from turning the data into something that can be
				used with ease. This involves removing unnecessary columns, transforming
				the data into the desired format, and translating certain data from
				Malay to English. Futhermore, some data must also be derived manually by
				performing operations on columns. Therefore, Python and its Pandas
				library are used extensively
				<a
					href="https://github.com/karmun2710/karmun2710.github.io/tree/main/python_analysis"
					>in this stage</a
				>. Complicated visualizations that plot based on geography (e.g
				chloropleth charts) are also created through Python's Matplotlib and
				GeoPandas.

			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<div>
				<p>
					The GE15 results showed that Malaysia is in a period of political flux
					and uncertainty. The ruling coalition, Barisan Nasional lost its
					majority, coming in third with 30 seats. Perikatan Nasional, a
					coalition of conservative and Islamist parties led by former Prime
					Minister Muhyiddin Yassin, came in second with 74 seats while Anwar
					Ibrahim’s Pakatan Harapan coalition won the most with 82 seats. The
					result show that ethnic structure is still a remarkably strong
					predictor of election outcomes in the peninsula and Malaysia is in a
					period of transition, and with the lack of a clear majority winner, it
					is likely that political uncertainty will persist in the coming
					months.
