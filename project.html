			<h2>An Analysis of the Malaysia's 15th General Election</h2>
			<p>
				Malaysia's 15th General Election (GE15) was held on Nov 19, 2022. It was
				the first General Election which allows Malaysians who are 18 years old or above to vote. 
				The election comes amidst a season of political
				turmoil (three prime ministers in four years), which followed the
				watershed May 2018 elections that saw the ruling coalition lose power
				for the first time since independence. The political landscape has made
				this election particularly unpredictable. The aim of my project is to
				give an overview of Malaysiaâ€™s 15th General Election. <br />

			<h2>
				Age, Gender and Ethnicity of Candidates Running for Malaysia's 15th
				General Election
			</h2>
			<p> 
				In this section, we break down every GE15 candidates by their age,
				gender and ethnicity. Data is downloaded directly from the
				<a href="https://dashboard.spr.gov.my/#!/home"
					>Malaysia General Election Website</a
				>. After uploading the data onto Github, the
				data is vizualized through Vega.js.
			</p>
			<div>
				<div id="genderChart" class="project_img"></div>
				<p>
					Malaysia has a higher ratio of female parliamentarians than many other developing countries. 
					However, there is still a wide gender gap in the representation of women in Malaysian politics as 
					majority tend to think men make better leaders. Thus, from the chart above, we can
					see that male candidates dominate the election landscape.


				</p>
				<div id="ethnicityChart" class="project_img"></div>
				<p>
					Bumiputera candidates are the clear majority because they are often seen as having closer ties to traditional Malay 
					culture, which can further increase their chances of winning. Constituency-level ethnic structure is a very robust and 
					consistent predictor of which coalition prevailed in elections on the peninsula. 
					 
				</p>
				<div id="ageChart" class="project_img"></div>
				<p>
					Although the voting age was lowered to 18, the median age of candidates is still within the 50 to 60 years old range.

			<h2>Voter Turnout</h2>
			<p>
				These charts compares the hourly figures between GE14 and GE15. One
				thing to note here is that it is normal to observe higher number of
				votes in GE15 despite lower turnout. This is because of the introduction
				of automatic voter registration and the lowering of legal voting age to
				in GE15. Data is sourced from this

			<h2>Ethnicity and GE15 Results</h2>
			<p>
				As mentioned just now, it is important to look through the results on the peninsula to get a
				sense of how ethnicity structures Malaysian politics. Here, I compare the vote
				share for each coalition with the bumiputera population share within
				that constituency.
				<b
					>Blue points are where the coalition in question lost; red points are
					where they won. </b
				>The deep structure of peninsular Malaysian politics jumps right out.
				There is one coalition that fares well in non-Malay majority
				constituencies. And the other two fare well in Malay-majority
				constituencies. We can see that the battleground is the mixed
				constituencies on the peninsula with 20-40% non-bumiputera populations.

			<h2>Rejected or Spoilt Votes</h2>
			<div>
				<img src="project\images\output.png" class="project_img" />
				<p>
					This is a choropleth map that shows the percentage of spoilt or
					rejected votes for each parliamentary seat. According to the Election Commission of Malaysia, rejected votes do not count towards the 
					total number of votes cast in the election, and therefore can have a significant impact on the outcome of the election.
					This chart is chosen because it allows for more intuitive and quicker interpretation of the
					data. We can see that rural areas, such as the north of the peninsula,
					tend to have a higher rate of rejected or spoilt votes. Data is
					downloaded from the
					<a href="https://dashboard.spr.gov.my/#!/home"
						>Malaysia General Election Website</a
					>. Python is used to construct this chart which can be found
					<a
						href="https://github.com/karmun2710/karmun2710.github.io/blob/main/python_analysis/Choropleth_Charts.ipynb"

			<h2>
				Total Seats Won by each political parties in GE15
			</h2>
			<div>
				<div id="chart1" class="project_img"></div>
				<p>
					The chart above shows the total seats won by political parties that contested in GE15. The ruling coalition, Barisan Nasional 
					lost its majority, coming in third with 30 seats. Perikatan Nasional, a
					coalition of conservative and Islamist parties led by former Prime
					Minister Muhyiddin Yassin, came in second with 74 seats while Pakatan Harapan coalition won the most with 82 seats.<br />The dataset is sourced
					from this
					<a
						href="https://github.com/karmun2710/karmun2710.github.io/blob/main/python_analysis/GE_15_candidates.ipynb"
						>Jupyter Notebook</a
					>. I used the Malaysian General Election python library to download
					data, enabling new data to be downloaded annually upon release. I had
					to reindex the tables and rename columns to merge the data smoothly
					before cleaning commas and quotation marks.

			<h2>Age of Sitting Prime Minister</h2>

				<!-- <img

				<p>
					I decided to include a chart that shows the age of sitting Prime Minister as Malaysia had three Prime Ministers in a short span of 4 years. 
					By observation, there is no obvious trend on the age of the prime
					minister throughout the years. Nonetheless, there are clear outliers.
					For instance, from 2018 to 2020, Tun Dr Mahathir was elected a second
					time to office, becoming the oldest serving state leader at 92 years
					old. The dataset pre-processing is done through Python which can be
					found

			<h2>Data and Challenges faced</h2>
			<p>
				This webpage is built using HTML, CSS and Javascript. It uses the
				<a href="https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/">vega-lite</a> Javascript API
				for constructing simple and interactive visualizations. Before building
				the front-end, the data is downloaded for preprocessing. All data is
				sourced from the
				<a href="https://dashboard.spr.gov.my/#!/home"
					>Malaysia General Election Website</a
				>.

				<br />
				<br /> Most of the challenges faced
				during this stage came from turning the data into something that can be
				used with ease. This involves removing unnecessary columns, transforming
				the data into the desired format, and translating certain data from
				Malay to English. Futhermore, some data must also be derived manually by
				performing operations on columns. Therefore, Python and its Pandas
				library are used extensively
				<a
					href="https://github.com/karmun2710/karmun2710.github.io/tree/main/python_analysis"
					>in this stage</a
				>. Complicated visualizations that plot based on geography (e.g
				chloropleth charts) are also created through Python's Matplotlib and
				GeoPandas.

			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<div>
				<p>
					The GE15 results demonstrated the deep divide between rural and urban voters, with 
					the opposition coalition doing well in the urban areas, while the incumbent government's coalition was able to maintain its 
					stronghold in the rural areas. It also highlighted the growing support for conservative Islamic parties. It is evident that ethnicity structure is still a remarkably 
					strong predictor of election outcomes in the peninsula and it is likely that political uncertainty will persist in the coming
					months.
