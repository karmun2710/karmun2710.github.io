        <div class="style1">
            <h3>Approval ratings</h3>
            <p>The first chart looks at to what extent do the people in United Kingdom approve of the government's record between 2020 and 2022.</p>
            <div class="chart" id="Chart1"></div>
        </div>

        <div class = "style1">
            <h3>Important issues</h3>
            <p>The second chart compares which issue (Health or Economy) the Britons think is the most important issue faced by their country between 2020 and 2022.</p>
            <div class="chart" id="Chart2"> </div>
        </div>
    <p>The two charts above were embedded from the rapid charts repository. </p>

<!--Week 2 Homework-->

    <h2>Week 2</h2>
</div>

    <div class = "style">

        <div class="style1">
            <h3>Outstanding IMF debt</h3>
            <p>This chart shows a chart of IMF Lending Outstanding in Nominal terms.</p>
            <div class="chart" id="Chart3"></div>
        </div>

        <div class = "style1">
            <h3>IMF lending outstanding as a percentage of GDP</h3>
            <p>This chart uses GDP data from each year to show the IMF Lending Outstanding.</p>
            <div class="chart" id="Chart4"> </div>
        </div>
    <p>Having adjusted the data to show credit outstanding as a percentage of global GDP, 1984 can be seen as the riskiest year due to its highest proportion of IMF lending to global GDP. </p>
    </div>

<!--Week 3 Homework-->
<div class = "title">
    <h2>Week 3</h2>
</div>
<div class = 'style'>
    <div class="style1">
        <h3>Labour Productivity Forecast (Bar Chart)</h3>
        <p>The data are derived as average hours worked multiplied by the corresponding and consistent measure of employment.</p>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart5"></div>
    </div>

    <div class = "style1">
        <h3>Labour Productivity Forecast (Line Chart)</h3>
        <p>This bar chart uses the same data as the previous chart, however, it is presented as a line chart.</p>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart6"> </div>
    </div>
    <p>I chose to modify it to a line chart instead of a bar chart as the data is a time series and therefore has a large numer of data points.</p>

            <p>I chose this website because the data did not require much cleaning and I was able to obtain the table directly from the url using Python. .</p>
