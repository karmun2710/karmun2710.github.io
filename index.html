<!--Week 1 Homework-->
<div class = "title">
    <h2>Week 1</h2>
</div>

    <div class = "style">

        <div class="style1">
            <h3>Approval ratings</h3>
            <p>The first chart looks at to what extent do the people in United Kingdom approve of the government's record between 2020 and 2022.</p>
            <div class="chart" id="Chart1"></div>
        </div>

        <div class = "style1">
            <h3>Important issues</h3>
            <p>The second chart compares which issue (Health or Economy) the Britons think is the most important issue faced by their country between 2020 and 2022.</p>
            <div class="chart" id="Chart2"> </div>
        </div>
    <p>The two charts above were embedded from the rapid charts repository. </p>
    </div>
</div>

<!--Week 2 Homework-->
<div class = "title">
    <h2>Week 2</h2>
</div>

    <div class = "style">

        <div class="style1">
            <h3>Outstanding IMF debt</h3>
            <p>This chart shows a chart of IMF Lending Outstanding in Nominal terms.</p>
            <div class="chart" id="Chart3"></div>
        </div>

        <div class = "style1">
            <h3>IMF lending outstanding as a percentage of GDP</h3>
            <p>This chart uses GDP data from each year to show the IMF Lending Outstanding.</p>
            <div class="chart" id="Chart4"> </div>
        </div>
    <p>Having adjusted the data to show credit outstanding as a percentage of global GDP, 1984 can be seen as the riskiest year due to its highest proportion of IMF lending to global GDP. </p>
    </div>
</div>

<!--Week 3 Homework-->
<div class = "title">
    <h2>Week 3</h2>
</div>

    <div class = "style">

        <div class="style1">
            <h3>Labour Productivity Forecast (Bar Chart)</h3>
            <p>The data are derived as average hours worked multiplied by the corresponding and consistent measure of employment.</p>
            <div class="chart" id="Chart5"></div>
        </div>

        <div class = "style1">
            <h3>Labour Productivity Forecast (Line Chart)</h3>
            <p>This bar chart uses the same data as the previous chart, however, it is presented as a line chart.</p>
            
            <div class="chart" id="Chart6"> </div>
        </div>
    <p>I chose to modify it to a line chart instead of a bar chart as the data is a time series and therefore has a large numer of data points.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<!--Week 4 Homework-->
<div class = "title">
    <h2>Week 4</h2>
    <div class = "style">

        
            <h3>Olympic Games Tokyo 2020</h3>
            <p>This chart shows the type and amount of medals received by the countries below during the Olympic Games in 2020.</p>
            <div class="widechart" id="Chart7"> </div>
            <p>The link to the colab where I conducted the data analysis can be seen <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1kiMCAf3abugN-c3NCk1eE4IHC7zMmrQ_?usp=share_link" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
            <p>I chose this website because the data did not require much cleaning and I was able to obtain the table directly from the url using Python.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<!--Week 5 Homework-->
<div class = "title">
    <h2>Week 5</h2>
    <div class = "style">

        
            <h3>Unemployment Rate</h3>
            <p>This chart shows the unemployment rate in the United Kingdom.</p>
            <p> I conducted the analysis using python in 
                <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ir-twjIhFXqW6dQ0Hyfo7aGPdIGm_B4g?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Google Colab</a>. </p>

<!--Week 7 Homework-->
<div class = "title">
    <h2>Week 7</h2>
</div>

    <div class = "style">
        <h3>Base Map of Germany</h3>
        <div class="chartmap" id="Chart17"></div>

        <h3>Healthcare Expenditure in Germany</h3>
        <div class="chartmap" id="Chart18"></div>
        <p>The cholorpleth map above shows the North-East region of Germany appears to spend the least on health relative 
        to other regions. This is largely due to the lower population density in this area. 
        In contrast, the region of 'Nordrhein-Westfalen' spends markedly more than any other region, due to higher levels of public and private expenditure. </p>
    </div>
</div>

<!--Week 8 Homework-->
<div class = "title">
    <h2>Week 8</h2>
</div>

    <div class = "style">

        <div class="style1">
            <h3>Gender that is more mentally affected by the pandemic</h3>
            <p>At the Festival of Economics, it was argued that the pandemic has impacted more women's mental health than men. </p>
            <div class="chart" id="Chart22"></div>
        </div>

        <div class = "style1">
            <h3>Unemployment rate of both gender during the pandemic</h3>
            <p>From the chart below, we know that the pandemic’s impact on women's employment is bigger than men.</p>
            <img src="164912_Figure1.jpg"height="350" width="450">
        </div>
        
        <p> Contextualising the graphs above, I argee with the statement made by professor's Sarah Smith. Women have been more impacted mentally than men during the 
        pandemic due to a number of factors, one of them being losing their source of income. </p>
    </div>
</div>

<!--Week 9 Homework-->
<div class = "title">
    <h2>Week 9</h2>
</div>

    <div class = "style">

        <div class="style1">
            <h3>Air Emissions and Population in European Countries</h3>
            <p>The scatter plot graph below determines whether air emissions has a correlation with the population.</p>
            <div class="chart" id="Chart19"></div>
        </div>

        <div class = "style1">
            <h3>Education and Climate Change</h3>
            <p>For this graph, I used a bubble graph to show the relationship between education and climate change.</p>
            <div class="chart" id="Chart20"> </div>
        </div>
    <p>I chose scatter plot graph and bubble graph as this week we were told to produce two charts that use advanced analytics.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<!--Week 10 Homework-->
<div class = "title">
    <h2>Week 10</h2>
</div>

<div class = "style">
    <h3>Supervised Learning – Regression</h3>
    <p>Hypothesis - The level of education in a given US state is linked to the average life expectancy at birth in years.
        Analysis used to create regression can be seen <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/10HAlc7bgcVVgWAh3FNaBViFp2-h1Szqf?usp=sharing"target="_blank">here.</a></p>
    <center>
        <img src="usa.png" height="300" width="400">
    </center>
    <p>From the graph above, we know that when the correlation is positive, the regression slope will be positive.</p>
